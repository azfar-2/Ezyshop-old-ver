### Ezyshop-old-ver

This is just an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file of the website, meaning that there is only the frontend part. If you want to see the whole functionality and the deployment, as well as the backend and payment integration, please check the [mdazfar2 Ezyshop GitHub repository](https://github.com/mdazfar2/Ezyshop).
